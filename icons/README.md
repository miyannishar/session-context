# Icons Directory

This directory should contain three PNG icon files for the SessionSwitch extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Quick Start: Generate Placeholder Icons

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in your web browser
2. Click "Download All Icons"
3. Save the downloaded files in this directory
4. Reload the extension in Chrome

## Alternative: Use Your Own Icons

You can create custom icons using any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, Figma, etc.):

1. Create three PNG images at the sizes listed above
2. Recommended design: 
   - Use the SessionSwitch brand colors (purple gradient: #667eea to #764ba2)
   - Include "S" or "SS" text
   - Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
3. Export as PNG
4. Name them exactly as specified above
5. Place them in this directory

## Icon Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Background**: Can be solid color or gradient
- **Content**: Simple, recognizable symbol or letters
- **Contrast**: Ensure visibility on both light and dark Chrome themes
- **Consistency**: All three sizes should look similar

## Notes

- The extension will not load without these icon files
- Make sure filenames match exactly (lowercase, no spaces)
- If you see broken icon images, check that:
  - Files exist in this directory
  - Filenames are correct
  - Files are valid PNG format
